## Abstract

*Climate change is disrupting ocean current speeds, causing unpredictable impacts on marine ecosystems. This study combines the Lotka-Volterra and Advection-Diffusion models, simulating dynamics with predation, advection and diffusion. The results reveal significant effects on predator-prey synchrony, notably that variance in current speeds away from equilibria can lead to potential ecosystem destabilisation.*
